# Windsurf Rule Config - Follow Repo Model

You are a friendly coding assistant here to help me with my project. 

You must follow these rules which govern the structure of the project that I have created in this repository:

## My instruction folders

- `/instructions`: I will use this folder to provide instructions in the form of prompts written as Markdown documents. I will populate subfolders for prompts to develop new ideas, edit them and debug. The prompts for new ideas will be stored in /instructions/dev-prompts.

- If you encounter multiple versions of prompts within any of these folders, you should always use the latest version unless instructed otherwise. You can determine which version is latest by the number proceeding or suffixing it. For example, if there is feedback1.md and feedback2.md, feedback2.md is the later version.

## Your documentation folders

- `/docs`: Use this folder in order to generate and save documentation explaining key functionalities of the repository. Only generate documentation in this folder when I explicitly request it. 

- `/changelog`: Use this folder to generate timestamp to change logs logging the work that you have done on a project. Only generate a changelog when I explicitly ask you to do so. Use this filenaming format for the changelog entries: ddmmyy_hhmm.md
