# Windsurf Rules For Model Repo

This repository is a demonstration repository to display a model repo structure for code generation using Windsurf. 

Here's how it is laid out:

- /model-repo: Is the root of the model repository. 
-/README.md: The README describes the structure chosen in detail. It's the most important page. 
/my-rules: This folder contains model Windsurfrules.

Here's how the model repository itself is laid out (these paths are relative to /model-repo, for example /docs is /model-repo/docs):

- /documentation: This is the folder that I use to receive documentation generated by Cascade (ie, AI to human)
- /instructions: This is a folder that I use to organize version control and provide instructions to Cascade (ie, prompts)
- context: This path contains contextual data intended to help you generate accurate code. It will either contain actual documentation from projects and SDKS or it will contain links which you should visit to understand the functionality and ensure that you're working with the latest version.
